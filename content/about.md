## Welcome to Wings of Tomorrow
The inspiration for Wings of Tomorrow came from a group of friends who discovered the power of mentorship during their careers as aviators in the United States Navy.
 
Together, they built Wings of Tomorrow to empower the next generation of aviators with the knowledge and resources they wish they had early in their careers

## Our Mission: 
The mission of Wings of Tomorrow is to provide the next generation of aviators with the opportunity for mentorship during their careers
