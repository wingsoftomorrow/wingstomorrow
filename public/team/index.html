<h2 id="lieutenant-matt-coen">Lieutenant Matt Coen</h2>
<h3 id="board-member-2">Board Member</h3>
<p><img src="/matt.PNG" alt="Matt Coen"></p>
<p>Matt grew up with his older brother Andy in the small Historic town of Placerville, California. He attended college at the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in Molecular Environmental Biology. While at Cal, Matt was a member of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) Program. Days after graduating, he earned his commission as an Ensign and set off for Pensacola, Florida for his initial flight training. He earned his Wings of Gold as a Naval Aviator in 2020, where he selected follow-on training in the Mighty MH-53E Sea Dragon, the Navy’s dedicated Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) and Heavy Lift aircraft. Matt spent time at both Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron (HM) 14 and HM-15 flying the “Big Iron,” and completed two deployments in U.S. Seventh Fleet and Fifth Fleet AORs, serving alongside and learning from the Navy’s top AMCM Pilots. As the 53 is an antiquated and aging aircraft, its legacy will soon come to an end as the airframe is removed from service in the coming years.
Matt was fortunate enough to be able to continue his passion for aviation and love of learning, as he was selected to become an instructor pilot in the MH-60S at HSC-2 in Norfolk, Viriginia—he’ll be mentoring and training the next generation of Fleet Replacement Pilots to employ the Seahawk worldwide in a variety of missions. Throughout Matt’s career, his mentors have instilled in him the power of teaching and his love for aviation. Through the Wings of Tomorrow organization, he hopes to return the favor and inspire and mentor those interested in the aviation industry.</p>
