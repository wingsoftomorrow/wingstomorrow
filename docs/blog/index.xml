      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Miguel, and I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University. I&amp;rsquo;m also the President of the Graduate Student Body and the co-founder of Dores Divest, a campus sustainable investments campaign. I grew up sailing in Annapolis, Maryland, but am now pleased to call Nashville home.
I have a diverse work history in public service, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue to employ myself in the pursuit of a more equitable world.</description>
